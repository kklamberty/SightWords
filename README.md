SightWords
==========

The idea behind this project is to let teachers create lists of sight words that their students may utilize in other apps like flashcards or sentence creation. My plan is for it to allow teachers to enter the lists and select which lists are available in much the same way that they add to students' collections by printing out flashcards for the students to take home and practice.
